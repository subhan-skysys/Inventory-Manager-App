# Inventory Manager

A cross-platform mobile inventory management application built with [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev). This app helps you track stock levels, manage inventory items, and monitor low stock alerts efficiently across iOS and Android.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: View overview of your inventory
- **All Items**: Browse and manage all inventory items with their current stock levels
- **Low Stock Alert**: Quickly identify items that are running low on stock
- **Create Items**: Add new items to your inventory with quantity and unit specifications
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices

## Tech Stack

- React Native 0.84.1
- TypeScript
- React 19.2.3
- React Native Safe Area Context
- Metro bundler

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Project Structure

```

├── screens/
│   ├── HomeScreen.tsx      # Main dashboard with navigation

│   ├── CreateScreen.tsx    # Add new items to inventory
│   └── LowStock.tsx        # View items with low stock
```

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully set up the Inventory Manager app. :partying_face:
